# matter-java
A 2D rigid body physics engine for Java, ported from [matter.js](https://github.com/liabru/matter-js)

## Notes
The goal of this port is to provide the same (or at least very similar) APIs as matter.js. It starts as a process of porting some of my works from javascript using p5js to java using processing. Renderer and svg related functions are not implemented as they can be replace easily with other java library.
